## **Reflection**

Over the duration of the semester, Team 102 has learned numerous things about embedded design. Some of our key lessons were to choose a project that is realistic for the time given and clearly verified to meet the project criteria, to stay proficient with the lab material because many of the schematics we used in our project were very similar to what we practiced in class, and to keep each other on track with a shared calendar of deadlines and details so we are not surprised by how extensive some assignments are.

### **Lessons Learned**

1. Over document everything that you can possibly document. Partial this is to prevent the surprise changes of documentation requests near the end of the project. As when we were getting close to the end of the project we saw several documentation requests both for the individual design and team design that were only vaguely hinted at through assignments or communication with the teaching team.
2. Do your best to test prototypes early and often. For Jacob's case he was testing a moisture sensor and didn't set aside time to test it early enough. Therefore, when it came time for check off the teaching team found a wire loop that was acting like a capacitor and that his sensor was responding well enough to not necessarily need signal conditioning. However, that would have violated the project so he needed to change some resistor values to condition it to a smaller range than originally specified. The wire acting like a capacitor was due to how it was connected to the galvanized nail.
3. Research more than you think you'll need and often when there is a slight question. There isn't really a story behind this one other than several nights filled with research trying to find why one portion of each of the subsystems was not responding as it should.
4. Master your tools before they are critically needed. Jacob was using Cadence to develop his PCB for this project whereas most of the team was using KiCad. This was primarily due to a difference in how we wanted to place it on resumes. However, Jacob got stuck several times learning hidden features of Cadence from the internet because the tutorials that were provided were for the bare bones and he tried to rely on them. Unfortunately, when it came down to crunch time on assignments before the project this caused more stress than was strictly necessary.

### **Recommendations for future students:**

- Spend extra time learning the coding portions at the beginning of the semester.  
- Spend time learning your ECAD system early on so you can be ahead for future assignments.
- If you have a teammate who isn’t pulling their weight, address it as soon as possible.  
- Consider investing in some of your own equipment, especially if you live farther from campus.  
- Try to schedule a regular meeting time with your group before or after every class.  
- Don’t rely on classroom parts always being available when it’s time to build your project.
