## Categories

Here we will go over the final ordered image in design ideation so that it is easier to read. The categories will be listed left to right from top to bottom.

### User Control

* Allow for control of how much water is released each run.
* Real-time moisture sensors to adjust watering based on soil conditions.
* Allow for control of how many times it runs a day.
* Manual override or scheduling feature to delay watering by user input.
* The user needs the option to pause or delay watering when it rains or during periods of high soil moisture.
* Weather forecast syncing via app or smart home integration.
* Notification system to inform the user when watering is paused or resumed.
* Easy to use wifi selection screen.
* Power indicator lights or app alerts to notify whe charging is needed.
* LED for programming mode and one indicating which line its programming currently.
* LCD screen display with LED warning indicator.
* Have light indicators to remind the user when it is in programming mode.
* Motorized panel to add focus element.

### Safety Features

* The user needs ta sealed and secure system that prevents leaks and over-watering.
* The product will use non-toxic, BPA-free materials that won't have harmful chemicals.
* The product will have a secure lid to prevent pets from drinking or contaminating the water.
* Electronics should be sealed with O-rings or gaskets.
* The device should be able to run in high summer temperatures without overheating.
* Covering protection or drainage channels in case of excess water.
* Pet safe water container.
* Easy-to-clean surfaces to maintain hygiene and prevent mold build-up.
* The product should have a weighted ballast (Not using the water as weight).
* The product should have tubing that expands when heated and shrinks when cooled.
* Electronics should be coated with a spray / drip sealant.
* Electronics should be soft coated.
* Electronics should be hard potted.
* Electronics should be submerged in a non-conductive fluid.
* The device should be made of materials that don't absorb heat as easily.
* The product should have a soft sleeve to cover itself.
* Ability to self-prime or auto-prime without manual intervention.
* Design with a factor of safety that would break if dropped from 100ft.
* Chemical treatments with a supply being provided by the user.

### Backups

* Create subsystems which can recover if one item goes down.
* Extra output taps for where the water comes out of the pipes as these can wear out easily with the water constantly coming out of them.
* Pipes should be easily replaceable if the heat does end up ruining them over time.
* When brought the device should come with extra parts for items that have a high likelihood to break.
* Compatibility with external power sources.
* Rain detection sensor that pauses watering during precipitation.
* Extra pipes due to bending and exposure.
* The device should include a squeeze bottle to fill the tank.
* The device should have a siphon line to fill up the tank from an outside source.
* Mounting pieces for if they want to put the device on a wall with multiple different pieces for different scenarios for mounting.
* Extra stakes so the pipe is able to be held down and not moves easily.
* One Blue LED for water alerts, red led for power.

### Physical Design

* Stable, tip-resistant design to avoid spills if bumped or nudged.
* Watertight seals and rubber washers at all tubing and connector joints.
* Rechargeable battery option with standard USB.
* The product's tank should be constructed of plastic.
* The product will have a UV-resistant body to prevent algae growth and keep water fresh.
* The product should have a dedicated capped port or valve that connects to a hose or pitcher for fast refills without removing the tank.
* The product should contain a hanging counter balance.
* The product should use a soft material for the tubing.
* The product should have a wide base.
* The product should have rubberized feet.
* Pipes should use materials to not significantly warp from heat.
* Able to plug into an outlet charger if desired.
* The product should use a water tank at the bottom to weight base.
* The product should have a removable tank that is inserted upside down into the device.
* The product should have an internal funnel for the tank.
* Add padding on the inside between layers to reduce shock.
* Use thicker material to increase footprint and spread of force.
* The product will have rounded outside corners.
* Rechargeable battery that is easy to replace.
* Possibly have a solar panel built in to save battery power.
* Steam chamber to boil the solvents out and have the water condense on the other side.
* Reverse Osmosis filter.
* Sand/gravel filter to get some fo the other debris.
* The product should be constructed out of a soft natural material.
* The product should be constructed out of ABS.
* Activated charcoal for a filter.
* LED for water, power, filter cleaning (time based).
* Arrow keys to switch between menu items and enter or exit.
* Create rounded corners to prevent fractures on corners.
* Turnable button and press to move between options and select.

### Standard Operation

* Wifi used to get weather forecast information if necessary.
* App can be used to show information on a different device over long distances such as on a phone.
* Make sure outputs don't leak when not in use.
* The water needs to be under enough pressure to release the water from each output equally.
* The product should operate as a standalone device.
* A hibernation mode for when the device is not active but still on.
* Make sure an adequate amount is used at each output then shut off.
* The device needs to hold sufficient power.
* Sufficient suction strength to draw water from low-pressure or gravity-fed containers.
* Reliable performance across varying water levels, including shallow or partially filed containers.
* Systems alerts for detecting leaks or abnormal flow.
* Clog-resistant intake design that handles minor debris or sediment without failure.
* Solid moisture sensor integration to skip watering when soil is already wet.
* Pressure-regulated emitters to ensure consistent flow rates.
* Battery life that supports multiple watering cycles without frequent recharging.
* Low-power standby mode to conserve energy between activations.
* Have an LED screen along with a way to choose menu items.

### Setup

* The product should include quick connect ends.
* Diagrams in a manual.
* Video link for setup instructions.
* Arrows pointing to connection points.
* Compatibility with small reservoirs such as buckets, tanks, or pet-safe containers.
* The user needs tubing that is easier to install on connectors without requiring additional tools or techniques.
* Create sub-modules to show to the user within a code base to interact with the other sections.
* Stickers to show connecting points.
* Specialized latch areas.
* The product should include a food safe lubricant for the insertion process.
* The product should include a flaring tool for tube ends.
* Using parts that have minimal power drain.
