This section is to allow the viewer a closer look at the elements on the whiteboard because the whiteboard didn't allow itself to be well condensed. This also happens to be the final ranked order of the user needs statments.

## **User Needs Table**

The categories were determined based on criticality to core device function, user impact and usability, technical dependencies and feasibility, risk and safety considerations and less critical but still important aspects. We were able to narrow that down into 11 categories in no specific order. The need statements in the table below are in order of importance with most important being first per category. Our Team determined the ranking based on direct impact on system reliability and core performance, user safety and failure prevention, user control and customization flexibility, ease of use and accessibility, environmental resilience and durability, convenience and aesthetic features, and redundancies and backups.
