### Main Method for Group Communication

Based on the information provided on in the "Team Member Communication Modes," the group primary method of communication is (to be determined after getting our final member to respond.)
 
## Communication Procedures

Our team will communicate in a respectful, supportive, and professional manner with each other as well as the teaching staff. For questions that can't be solved internally and require the assistance of the instructor, it will fall to the Assignment leader for that period to ask. From there, they will update the team when an answer has been provided and see if any further follow up is required.
<!-- blocking questions out if we want to address them later - JD
1. How will your team communicate?  this will be solved via communication choices ideally top 2>
2. How will you handle instructor correspondence? Who is responsible? How will that be communicated with/back to the group? -->

## Meeting Coordination

Our team will use our main established communication methods to remind group members of meetings. Reminders can also be done in person during class time, assuming all members are present and aware of when the meeting will be held.

Changes or additional meeting times will require all members to be informed and aware. Members will collaborate to agree upon a time that fits every persons schedule and aligns with each persons availability. 

Preferred meeting format can vary depending on each members preference or availability, agreement for format can be determined before scheduled meeting. This could also result in hybrid meeting formats where some members are only able to join virtually. 
<!-- Left other procedures empty at the moment -->


## Roles & Responsibilities

Our team will assign roles through a collaborative process that ensures fairness and active participation from every member. Roles will be rotated on a regular basis—approximately every two weeks—so that each individual gains experience in multiple aspects of the project. Assignments will be determined by consensus, taking into account each member’s skills, interests, and developmental goals, while maintaining flexibility to adapt as project needs evolve. Team members will support one another by sharing knowledge, offering feedback, and stepping in when responsibilities overlap or challenges arise. If adjustments are needed, the team will openly discuss and readjust roles to maintain balance and efficiency. Activities and milestones will be tracked using a shared calender, ensuring transparency and accountability. Technical responsibilities will be distributed based on both expertise and the opportunity for learning, so that all members contribute while also expanding their capabilities.

Our team will ensure the submissions are on time by setting internal deadlines ahead of official due dates and requiring every member to review and sign off on the final work before submission. To guarantee that each member is prepared for their responsibilities, we will share resources, help each other where possible, and adjust assignments when additional guidance is needed. Feedback from design reviews will be documented in our communication channel, with clear action items assigned and tracked until completion. If a member misses a contribution or fails to meet expectations, the team will first address the issue through internally, offering support and strategies for improvement. Should this continue, the team will implement progressive accountability measures, ranging from redistribution of tasks to formal reporting, with the understanding that consistent failure to improve may result a recommendation to the teaching faculty for transition to another team. Through communication, accountability, and support, we will maintain both individual responsibility and collective success.

## Conflict Recognition & Resolution

Our team recognizes that differences of opinion are an inevitable and valuable part of collaboration, and we will address them to remain focused on completing the project. We will talk through disagreements when they arise and treat them as opportunities for dialogue rather than obstacles to progress. To minimize conflicts of interest with the project, we will ensure that project roles and responsibilities are clearly defined and distributed fairly, preventing any one member from being overburdened. Should conflicts occur, we will resolve them internally through respectful discussion and compromise, and will only escalate issues to the instructor when they cannot be managed within the team. By approaching disagreements with openness, fairness, and accountability, we will ensure an environment where our differing opinions and skill sets will strengthen the quality of our work.
