## Team Introduction 
 Greetings, we are team 102 for EGR 304 at Arizona State University. Our goal is to use four individual projects that can then be combined to form a more complex system that will achieve a more streamlined, resource saving, or automated process for the home. This project will require us to learn embedded system architecture, coding processes, project resource management, cross discipline communication, and interaction with sensor to a higher degree than we have proceeded before.
