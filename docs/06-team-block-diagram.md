## Research Question

* How can a capacitive resistor measure moisture?
* Is the only way for a pic18F54Q43 to control a motor through an H-Bridge?
* How does I2C communication work?
* Why does the connector need 8 pins if UART and I2c both have 1 receive and 1 send channel?
* How can we ensure the pumps stay primed?
