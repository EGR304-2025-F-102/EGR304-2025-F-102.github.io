## **Project Objective** <!--JACOB: Fertilizer addition, drip irrigation continuity, sensor for how much solvents in the water and how much is there OR how much soil resitivity for pH and solvent absorption.-->

This project aims to investigate and develop smart plant irrigation technologies, an improved user experience, improved product design, and product customization options for the irrigation technology. The target is to create a competitive product in the self-irrigating plant market, create sales and expand the user base more towards luxury and ease of access. We believe that adding drip irrigation continuity, pH management for the water, and an interchangeable filter for solvents will increase our competitive nature with our target users.

<!--This project aims to investigate and develop smart adaptive technologies, an improved user experience, better fit, improved product design, and product customization options for the next-generation AirPods. The target is to maintain global dominance in the wireless earphone market, drive up AirPod sales to 100 million+ units sold with a 60% global market share in 2021 and expand the user base more towards the luxury, professional, and fitness segments. We believe that adding smart interactions and adaptive audio filters alone will already expand our user base by 15%. With the new generation AirPods we aim to match at least the sound quality of our main competitor, the Sony WF-1000XM3, and include Active Noise Canceling that is also featured in Mifo, House of Marley, Bose, and Amazon Echo products. We will also obtain IPX4 sweat-resistant rating equal to Bose, House of Marley, and Amazon Echo earbuds, and aim to extend our range of colors, as seen in Urbanista and Jabra’s lifestyle products.-->

## **Stakeholders** <!-- terry -->

- **Target User** People with the intention of caring for and nuturing plant life, and in need of a system that can reliably  distribute water to plant life.
- **Target purchaser** Target purchasers include people who want an irrigation system with the ability to keep track and account for all variables, such as tracking ph levels, and filtering solvents.
- **Customer service** Prefers easy-to-repair and easy to understand watering system. Easy to answer questions about ph sensor and filter.
- **Marketing & Sales division** Looks for selling points around system functions such as ph level sensor and and solvent filter.
- **Retailers** Prefer products that can be easily stored and keep tracked of. Irrigation system can be store in one container for one product.

## **Use Cases** <!-- jacob and terry -->

**User Story #1: Mario**
Mario has never owned more than one plant at a time in his life. However, now that his new girlfriend has moved in with him he has been tasked with keeping several plants alive. Between keeping up with his social, work, dating life Mario is really busy and forgets to water his plants on a regular basis. With this system Mario only needs to remember to fill up the water tank, and allow the system to regularly water his plants for him. Mario doesn't have to worry about all the details of plant care due to several of them being taken care of by the system and he gets to impress his girlfriend.

<!--
Jenna is a 33-year-old executive who regularly visits a bar for lunch to blow off some steam. The bar is often loud with people, but it is paramount that she can hold business conversations over the phone there. Then again, she does not want to miss out on the atmosphere and be able to hear the waiters as well. Her new Apple wireless earphones allow her to switch instantly between a mode where she can fully focus on the phone conversation and a mode where the phone call and environmental sound are seamlessly combined. They also allow her to rapidly adjust the volume on the earbuds themselves without having to take out her phone.

Jenna occasionally visits the bar in the evenings. She is a big fan of the L.A. Lakers, and whenever they play, she streams the live footage through her phone. Her new earbuds allow her to easily switch to hearing everything around her and streaming the match commentary without having to ever take the earbuds out.  She sometimes gets compliments on how stylish the earbuds look on her, and she wouldn’t want to miss out on hearing those either.-->

**User Story #2: Barry**
Barry is a 25-year-old student-worker who is irregularly at home between class and work schedules. Barry grew up in a house that had potted plants and loved the fresher air that came along with them. The again, he lives on his own and doesn't often remember to water them. With his new irrigation device he no longer has to worry about watering all his plants nightly or even biweekly. This frees up Barry to focus on his course work and professional development while enabling him to have healthy house plants.

Over school breaks Barry occasionally gets the time to go out for a vacation or to visit his parents for a week. Now instead of having one of his friends come water his plants and make a mess. He can relax in style knowing that they're having fun and his plants are thriving back at home. He even sometimes gets compliments about how healthy his plants look from his neighbor Susan.

## **Open Questions** <!-- Austin -->

- Can we have our product be compatible with any water container size?
- Can we create a product that blends into the home environment?
- Can we ensure that our PH sensors wont come out of specification.
- Can we ensure replacement parts are included in case of hard water build up.
