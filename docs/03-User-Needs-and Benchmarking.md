by the current market. In order to make a useful item to the everyday house owner, 
cleaner, and guardian we must search in the places where their voices can be heard.

| "Total game-changer for plant parents! This smart watering system has been a lifesaver for my 20 plants. The programmable timer and Alexa compatibility make it super easy to use. No more overwatering or underwatering — my plants are thriving! The setup was a breeze, and the system's reliability gives me peace of mind. Highly recommend!" | 1.

Turned it on for a couple hours one day, and the next day I turned it on, left the house for 5 hours and returned to a dead battery. It's really cute, the interchangeable details are held to the sign well. The bow needed a little fluffing, but that was due to shipping. I just wish the battery in the back light lasted longer." | 5.

| "... This kit comes with enough drip heads for 20 plants though it would be easy to buy more. They're pretty standard. It also comes with plenty of T junctions and plugs and whatever else you'll need to build your custom setup... The water pressure is really good. I was surprised. The furthest plant I have from the tank has to be nearly 20 feet and it was already dripping before I got up to check it. The pressure is adequate for plenty of plants..." | 7.

| "The device seems to be a great idea; however, the manufacturer provides virtually NO documentation. I also could not locate a website to ask for help.

| This is working so well for me on my balcony. I am watering ten plants. The timer is easy to set up as well. I am north facing and the panel gets plenty of solar energy to complete daily waterings. The green bucket holds 5 gallons of water. At daily watering for 5 minutes per time, it lasts a full week. Plants are very happy in the Texas heat. | 1. Device needs to function over a longer duration of time. (latent) <br>2. Device must be able to withstand hot environments. (latent) <br>3. Device must be able to withstand cold environment. (latent) <br>4. Device needs minimal footprint. (latent) <br>5. The device needs to hold sufficient power. (explicit) |
| Some very good features - Fairly intuitive to program. My only complaint would be that the pump could be stronger (it really wants to be at the same level as the plants and the water). Also the filter could be shorter so that you can get more water out of your tank before the sensor shuts it off. I'm planning on making my own tank with a cutout for the filter so that it sits lower than the bottom of the rest of the water. | 6. Pump needs to be able to pull water. (explicit) <br>7. Water filter needs to be efficient for size. (latent) <br>8. Water filter needs to have a small footprint. (latent) <br>9. The device needs to alert when low on water. (explicit) <br>10. The device needs to handle sub-optimal positioning to plants. (latent) |

| This product is a good concept for people with a small pot garden and no available hose outlet, such as on a patio or balcony. However, the plastic drippers are made of very soft plastic and are very difficult to insert fully into the tubing. Before they can be fully inserted, they typically bend or twist, and once that happens, they are finished. I tried warming the tubing with hot water, and gently using a heat gun, and even tried lubricating with soapy water, but nothing helped. | 1. The device needs to be compatible with parts. <br>2. The device needs design tolerance for material warpage and assembly. <br>3. The device needs a tool to assist difficult assembly parts. |
| This solar drip irrigation system sounded great, but it didn’t meet my expectations. The solar panel needs full sun for a long time, or it won’t charge well. The pump is weak and couldn’t deliver water evenly to all 15 pots. The instructions were also confusing and made setup harder than it should be. It worked a little once running, but I had to keep checking on it. I gave it 2 stars because the idea is good, but the performance was not reliable. | 4. Device needs to evenly deliver water to setup outputs. <br>5. Device needs a way to quickly charge energy. <br>6. Setup needs to be straightforward. |

The device is versatile in growing media types. (explicit) |
| "It took about a week to get the watering levels exactly where I wanted them because while you can water multiple plants at one time, there is only one siphon from your water source. So, you have to adjust the flow for each plant accordingly. Very easily done, it just takes a little tweaking." |          2. The user needs precise, easily adjustable controls to calibrate watering levels across multiple outputs. (latent) |

## Process

After gathering the user needs statements from these customer's who voiced their needs in regard to these products we started to group them.

![Image of user needs spread out](UngroupedChaosUserNeeds.jpg)

In order to fully get the groups flushed out we decided to keep a focus on items that were relatively close to each other. That being said there were a few groups that stuck out:

- Device functional requirements.
- Watering system and pump features.
- User interface and control.
- Alerts and monitoring
- Tubing, hoses, and water delivery hardware
- Power and energy
- Setup and Assembly
- Environmental and physical conditions
- Design and Aesthetics
- Water quality and filtration
- Parts that don't match other conditions so Miscellaneous

![Image with groups for user needs](GroupingsUserNeeds.jpg)

Next we needed to rank the requirements. For the groups we had 4 deciding factors:
 - Critical to core functionality
 - User impact and usability
 - Technical feasibility
 - Risk and Safety concerns

 Once the groups were organized we were able to focus on ranking the needs themselves. Since their groups were a product of their similarities we decided that it should stay similar for their rankings.

 - Direct impact on system reliability and core performance
    > Ensure the system works, water delivery is consistent, and critical alerts are in place. 
 - User safety and failure prevention
    > Alerts for low water or power, leak prevention and system failure points.
 - User Control and customization flexibility 
    > Features allowing users to customize their watering schedules and control work flows.
 - Ease of use and accessibility
    > Items that reduce complexity, improve setup, or simplify operations.
 - Environmental durability
    > Ability to withstand heat, cold, and physical relocation.
 - Convenience
    > Ease of installation and aesthetic decisions
 - Redundancies and backups
    > Backup's in case of weaker main systems. 

    Finally we had the end result of the ranked tables which can be found below in order of the deemed most important needs to less important needs. 


#### User Needs Table
The categories were determined based on criticality to core device function, user impact and usability, technical dependencies and feasibility, risk and safety considerations and less critical but still important aspects. We were able to narrow that down into 11 categories in no specific order. The need statments in the table below are in order of importance with most important being first per catagory. Our Team determined the ranking based on direct impact on system reliability and core performance, user safety and failure prevention, user control and customization flexibility, ease of use and accessibility, environmental resilience and durability, convenience and aesthetic features, and redundancies and backups.
