## Introduction to the Process
<!-- I want another place besides amazon -->

cur, aut in adhuc crimina **habebat**: pro.-->

Turned it on for a couple hours one day, and the next day I turned it on, left the house for 5 hours and returned to a dead battery. It's really cute, the interchangeable details are held to the sign well. The bow needed a little fluffing, but that was due to shipping. I just wish the battery in the back light lasted longer."  |5.

This is a fantastic functional smart unit. It does everything I need it to do and it does it easily. I water my plants using aquarium water because fish produce their own quite amazing fertilizer. This pump unit sucks water directly out of the sump that supplies my linked aquariums. It could just as easily take it out of any aquarium if you are lucky enough to have one. The intake hoses include air stones as filters which is a great invention. I've been doing that for years on another terrarium mister and it works great. This unit has two full-strength pumps. I chose to use 1/4" irrigation tubing because I happen to have a lot of that. This kit comes with clear tubing which is more flexible and less visible. Now that I've tested with the stuff I have, my next round on the second pump will be the clear tubing because it will be on a more visible circuit. This kit comes with enough drip heads for 20 plants though it would be easy to buy more. They're pretty standard. It also comes with plenty of T junctions and plugs and whatever else you'll need to build your custom setup. There are some complaints about the Tuya app requiring personal information and I completely agree. I used Tuya the first time a few years ago and was super leery. They've since expanded to be a pretty standard interface. Once you use the app to connect to Alexa (or whichever your home automation program of choice is) you can disable it again. The experience was really user friendly. As it is, I now have this set up to water my plants on a weekly basis for just a couple minutes per week. I may invest in some better drip heads that are more adjustable flow drippers so I can customize the amount of water per pot rather than just to the whole circuit. The water pressure is really good. I was surprised. The furthest plant I have from the tank has to be nearly 20 feet and it was already dripping before I got up to check it. They pressure is adequate for plenty of plants. The next step for me will be to research and **buy a smart moisture meter** so this will automatically water when my plants get to a certain dryness. I love this.

| "The device seems to be a great idea; however, they manufacturer provides virtually NO documentation. I also could not locate a website to ask for help. In 30 years of receiving items (books in the 90s), I have never given a rating of ONE star. Without good setup instructions, I will likely return the item for a refund and purchase another."

| This is working so well for me on my balcony. I am watering ten plants. The timer is easy to set up as well. I am north facing and the panel gets plenty of solar energy to complete daily waterings. The green bucket holds 5 gallons of water. Aat daily watering for 5 minutes per time, it lasts a full week. Plants are very happy in the Texas heat.  |1.

|   |4. Device needs minimal footprint. (latent)|
|   |5. The device needs to hold sufficient power. (explicit)|
|Some very good features - Fairly intuitive to program. My only complaint would be that the pump could be stronger (it really wants to be at the same level as the plants and the water). Also the filter could be shorter so that you can get more water out of your tank before the sensor shuts it off. I'm planning on making my own tank with a cutout for the filter so that it sits lower than the bottom of the rest of the water   |6. Pump needs to be able to pull water (explicit)|

| This product is a good concept for people with a small pot garden and no available hose outlet, such as on a patio or balcony. However, the plastic drippers are made of very soft plastic and are very difficult to insert fully into the tubing. Before they can be fully inserted, they typically bend or twist, and once that happens, they are finished. I tried warming the tubing with hot water, and gently using a heat gun, and even tried lubricating with soapy water, but nothing helped. |1. The device needs to be compatible with parts.|
|   |2. The device needs design tolerance for material warpage and assembly. |
|   |3. The device needs a tool to assist difficult assembly parts.|
This solar drip irrigation system sounded great, but it didn’t meet my expectations. The solar panel needs full sun for a long time, or it won’t charge well. The pump is weak and couldn’t deliver water evenly to all 15 pots. The instructions were also confusing and made setup harder than it should be. It worked a little once running, but I had to keep checking on it. I gave it 2 stars because the idea is good, but the performance was not reliable.   |4. Device needs to evenly deliver water to setup outputs. (explicit)|
