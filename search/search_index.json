I just wish the battery in the back light lasted longer.\"  |5. Device needs to have efficient power use. (latent) | |   |6. Device needs to have back up option for power. (latent) | This is a fantastic functional smart unit. It does everything I need it to do and it does it easily. I water my plants using aquarium water because fish produce their own quite amazing fertilizer. This pump unit sucks water directly out of the sump that supplies my linked aquariums. It could just as easily take it out of any aquarium if you are lucky enough to have one. The intake hoses include air stones as filters which is a great invention. I've been doing that for years on another terrarium mister and it works great. This unit has two full-strength pumps. I chose to use 1/4\" irrigation tubing because I happen to have a lot of that. This kit comes with clear tubing which is more flexible and less visible. Now that I've tested with the stuff I have, my next round on the second pump will be the clear tubing because it will be on a more visible circuit. This kit comes with enough drip heads for 20 plants though it would be easy to buy more. They're pretty standard. It also comes with plenty of T junctions and plugs and whatever else you'll need to build your custom setup. There are some complaints about the Tuya app requiring personal information and I completely agree. I used Tuya the first time a few years ago and was super leery. They've since expanded to be a pretty standard interface. Once you use the app to connect to Alexa (or whichever your home automation program of choice is) you can disable it again. The experience was really user friendly. As it is, I now have this set up to water my plants on a weekly basis for just a couple minutes per week. I may invest in some better drip heads that are more adjustable flow drippers so I can customize the amount of water per pot rather than just to the whole circuit. The water pressure is really good. I was surprised. The furthest plant I have from the tank has to be nearly 20 feet and it was already dripping before I got up to check it. They pressure is adequate for plenty of plants. The next step for me will be to research and buy a smart moisture meter so this will automatically water when my plants get to a certain dryness. I love this.    |7.

The target is to maintain global dominance in the wireless earphone market, drive up AirPod sales to 100 million+ units sold with a 60% global market share in 2021 and expand the user base more towards the luxury, professional, and fitness segments. We believe that adding smart interactions and adaptive audio filters alone will already expand our user base by 15%. With the new generation AirPods we aim to match at least the sound quality of our main competitor, the Sony WF-1000XM3, and include Active Noise Canceling that is also featured in Mifo, House of Marley, Bose, and Amazon Echo products. We will also obtain IPX4 sweat-resistant rating equal to Bose, House of Marley, and Amazon Echo earbuds, and aim to extend our range of colors, as seen in Urbanista and Jabra\u2019s lifestyle products.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"04-Product-Requirements/#stakeholders","title":"Stakeholders","text":"<ul> <li>Target group High-income upper-class professionals between the age of 20 and 45.
