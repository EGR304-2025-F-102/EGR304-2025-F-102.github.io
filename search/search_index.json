Mario is really busy between homework and job work so he does not have the time nor does he always remember his plants exist. With this new irrigation system Mario no longer needs to water every single plant regularly, instead he just needs to keep the water source full and let the irrigation system do the work.</p> <p>Mario no longer has to worry about dying plants and getting charged extra from the landowner. He even uses water with proper ph levels, which he can now figure out from the sensor that is included in the system. His landowner is even impressed by how healthy the plants are.</p> <p>User Story #2: Barry Barry is a 25-year-old student-worker who is irregularly at home between class and work schedules. Barry grew up in a house that had potted plants and loved the fresher air that came along with them. The again, he lives on his own and doesn't often remember to water them. With his new irrigation device he no longer has to worry about watering all his plants nightly or even biweekly. This frees up Barry to focus on his course work and professional development while enabling him to have healthy house plants.</p> <p>Over school breaks Barry occasionally gets the time to go out for a vacation or to visit his parents for a week. Now instead of having one of his friends come water his plants and make a mess. He can relax in style knowing that they're having fun and his plants are thriving back at home.

To minimize conflicts of interest with the project, we will ensure that project roles and responsibilities are clearly defined and distributed fairly, preventing any one member from being overburdened. Should conflicts occur, we will resolve them internally through respectful discussion and compromise, and will only escalate issues to the instructor when they cannot be managed within the team. By approaching disagreements with openness, fairness, and accountability, we will ensure an environment where our differing opinions and skill sets will strengthen the quality of our work.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"Appendix/App-Team-Org/#signatures","title":"Signatures","text":"<p>These signatures affirm that the team members will uphold to the best of their ability the standards of conduct that have been put forth in this document.    -  Terry Williams    -  Austin Gonzalez    -  Jacob Dirks</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"Appendix/another-subfile/","title":"Appendix - Secondary sub page","text":"<p>Things to discuss</p>"},{"location":"Appendix/basic-markdown-examples/","title":"Appendix - Basic Markdown Examples","text":""},{"location":"Appendix/basic-markdown-examples/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>Bold Text Italic Text Bold and Italic Text</p>"},{"location":"Appendix/basic-markdown-examples/#research-question","title":"Research Question","text":"<ul> <li>Bullet Point 1</li> <li>Bullet Point 2</li> <li>Bullet Point 3</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Appendix/basic-markdown-examples/#images","title":"Images","text":"<p> Figure 2: Early PCB working design</p> <p> Figure 3: Innovation Showcase Spring '25, where the products were a STEM-themed display that demonstrates a single scientific/engineering concept with the intended user of K-12 students interested in learning about science, technology, engineering, or math.</p>"},{"location":"Appendix/basic-markdown-examples/#results","title":"Results","text":"<ol> <li>Numbered Point 1</li> <li>Numbered Point 2</li> <li>Numbered Point 3</li> </ol>"},{"location":"Appendix/basic-markdown-examples/#conclusions-and-future-work","title":"Conclusions and Future Work","text":""},{"location":"Appendix/basic-markdown-examples/#external-links","title":"External Links","text":"<p>example link to idealab</p>"},{"location":"Appendix/basic-markdown-examples/#results_1","title":"Results","text":"<ol> <li>Numbered Point 1</li> <li>Numbered Point 2</li> <li>Numbered Point 3</li> </ol>"},{"location":"Appendix/basic-markdown-examples/#conclusions-and-future-work_1","title":"Conclusions and Future Work","text":""},{"location":"Appendix/basic-markdown-examples/#external-links_1","title":"External Links","text":"<p>example link to idealab</p>"},{"location":"Appendix/basic-markdown-examples/#references","title":"References","text":""},{"location":"Appendix/charts/","title":"Appendix - Charts","text":"<pre><code>graph LR\n  A[Start] --&gt; B{Error?};\n  B --&gt;|Yes| C[Hmm...];\n  C --&gt; D[Debug];\n  D --&gt; B;\n  B ----&gt;|No| E[Yay!];</code></pre> <pre><code>sequenceDiagram\n  autonumber\n  Alice-&gt;&gt;John: Hello John, how are you?\n  loop Healthcheck\n      John-&gt;&gt;John: Fight against hypochondria\n  end\n  Note right of John: Rational thoughts!\n  John--&gt;&gt;Alice: Great!\n  John-&gt;&gt;Bob: How about you?\n  Bob--&gt;&gt;John: Jolly good!</code></pre> <pre><code>stateDiagram-v2\n  state fork_state &lt;&lt;fork&gt;&gt;\n    [*] --&gt; fork_state\n    fork_state --&gt; State2\n    fork_state --&gt; State3\n\n    state join_state &lt;&lt;join&gt;&gt;\n    State2 --&gt; join_state\n    State3 --&gt; join_state\n    join_state --&gt; State4\n    State4 --&gt; [*]</code></pre>"}]}
