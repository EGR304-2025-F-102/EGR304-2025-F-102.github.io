This irrigation project can be split up into several sections and each one will be managed by a single team member. Jacob Dirks will handle the moisture sensor to ensure we avoid over-watering the plant and drowning it. Austin Gonzalez is in charge of handling the main reservoir pump. and brings in a new feature that allows the user to not have to worry about scheduling fertilizer for their plant. Terry Williams is in charge of communication between the various subsystems and monitoring the internal reservoir system to alert the consumer when the tank is low.

This allowed our ideas to flourish without even a hint of fear of judgement. The result was as you just read a very well thought out list of ideas with characteristics coming from each team member. Although good luck figuring out who provided each idea. We did this assignment with quick meetings after class and through asynchronous work that was then compiled features onto a google doc for ease of sharing. The features were brainstormed from user needs and requirements developed in the User Needs and Benchmarking assignment. In order to choose the best elements each individual was allowed to choose based on their discretion. Austin prioritized ease of use, reliability, and safety as the basis for the requirements he chose and then proceeded to turn into features. Jacob chose requirements to boost product lifespan, user understanding and ease of setup. Terry chose based on the requirements perceived impact on durability and quality for different parts of the project. David focused on requirements that could build an easily maintainable device for a variety of circumstances. After gathering all of the features we looked at common ways to solve the problem either through brief google searches or by pulling up ideas that we\u2019ve seen in the wild. This left our document with a number of features which we brought into a digital whiteboard which is shown in the images above. This white board allowed for easier movement of the features and facilitated the conversation with the group. This allowed us to group based on the six traits we recognized across each member\u2019s features. These groups are User Control, Physical Design, Standard Operation, Safety Features, Backups, and Safety. Once grouped we ranked them based on core functionality which impacts project design, user experience which impacts our saleability, durability which builds safety, and extra values for things outside of the current needs.</p> <p>In the end we went with a design that merged Terry's smart metering with Austin's simple interface to create a system that keeps the footprint minimal as well as easier for the user to interact with, keeping with our developed user needs.

These ribbon connectors also come with some decisions about how information is getting sent and who should receive what signals. For this case we thought it would be best to keep the communication simple as to reduce risk of electric noise causing havoc throughout the lifespan of the product. In order to achieve this, we decided that Austin's subsystem, the pump, would request information from both Terry, who reads the level of water inside the tank, and Jacob, who reads moisture in the soil, before making his decision regarding the action of pumping water. This requires both a request signal and to ensure compatibility later on or knowledge of damage a processing signal. From there Jacob and Austin needed to communicate information about the Moisture signal and in order to ensure that the moisture signal wouldn't be interpreted strangely on the older version of MPLAB, Jacob sent the analog signal to Austin. They also needed to use 2 more backup pins to create a timer relay after a fourth team member dropped the class and required functionality to be shifted.

Therefore, when it came time for check off the teaching team found a wire loop that was acting like a capacitor and that his sensor was responding well enough to not necessarily need signal conditioning. However, that would have violated the project so he needed to change some resistor values to condition it to a smaller range than originally specified. The wire acting like a capacitor was due to how it was connected to the galvanized nail.</li> <li>Research more than you think you'll need and often when there is a slight question. There isn't really a story behind this one other than several nights filled with research trying to find why one portion of each of the subsystems was not responding as it should.</li> <li>Master your tools before they are critically needed. Jacob was using Cadence to develop his PCB for this project whereas most of the team was using KiCad. This was primarily due to a difference in how we wanted to place it on resumes. However, Jacob got stuck several times learning hidden features of Cadence from the internet because the tutorials that were provided were for the bare bones and he tried to rely on them. Unfortunately, when it came down to crunch time on assignments before the project this caused more stress than was strictly necessary.</li> <li>When you have a light week work ahead as much as possible. This will help ensure when your other projects start getting busy or when other classes in general get busy you have a buffer. In turn this will make your disposition lighter, keep the stress down, and keep the team happier. At times our team was able to accomplish this other times requirements changed near the due date and we had to readapt.</li> <li>Expect alterations to the requirements and expectations daily. Most of the time you could get away with reading through the requirements each time an assignment comes up. However, there were several that changed a number of times either due to over estimations on the teaching side or class wide problems on the student side. Whatever the case may be, we had to quickly adjust several times and that flexibility should be helpful in later projects.</li> <li>Make friends fast with both the teaching team and your team. This will not only help ensure you can get help when needed but also allow you to ask questions and get more work done in crunch zones due to the support from others.</li> <li>Quadruple check something if there's event a slight bit of uncertainty and its a new topic for you. This would have saved a lot of time from building the schematic to even setting up the block diagram and software design. As there were simple errors that while not technically invalid were not what the class wanted and that caused more time to be eaten up to fix it rather than having asked questions early on.</li> <li>You're never the only one whose having issues, chances are others are having the same issues as you. Utilize the discussion boards and also walk around class and talk to people about whats going on in their projects.</li> <li></li> </ol>"},{"location":"09-Reflection/#recommendations-for-future-students","title":"Recommendations for future students:","text":"<ul> <li>Spend extra time learning the coding portions at the beginning of the semester.  </li> <li>Spend time learning your ECAD system early on so you can be ahead for future assignments.</li> <li>If you have a teammate who isn\u2019t pulling their weight, address it as soon as possible.  </li> <li>Consider investing in some of your own equipment, especially if you live farther from campus.  </li> <li>Try to schedule a regular meeting time with your group before or after every class.  </li> <li>Don\u2019t rely on classroom parts always being available when it\u2019s time to build your project.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Appendix/","title":"Appendix - Main Page","text":"<p>The Appendix is where we store supporting information that would have made the main body difficult to read.
