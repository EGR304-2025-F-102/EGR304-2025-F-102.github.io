Turned it on for a couple hours one day, and the next day I turned it on, left the house for 5 hours and returned to a dead battery. It's really cute, the interchangeable details are held to the sign well. The bow needed a little fluffing, but that was due to shipping. I just wish the battery in the back light lasted longer.\"  |5. Device needs to have efficient power use. (latent) | |   |6. Device needs to have back up option for power. (latent) | This is a fantastic functional smart unit. It does everything I need it to do and it does it easily. I water my plants using aquarium water because fish produce their own quite amazing fertilizer. This pump unit sucks water directly out of the sump that supplies my linked aquariums. It could just as easily take it out of any aquarium if you are lucky enough to have one. The intake hoses include air stones as filters which is a great invention. I've been doing that for years on another terrarium mister and it works great. This unit has two full-strength pumps. I chose to use 1/4\" irrigation tubing because I happen to have a lot of that. This kit comes with clear tubing which is more flexible and less visible. Now that I've tested with the stuff I have, my next round on the second pump will be the clear tubing because it will be on a more visible circuit. This kit comes with enough drip heads for 20 plants though it would be easy to buy more. They're pretty standard. It also comes with plenty of T junctions and plugs and whatever else you'll need to build your custom setup. There are some complaints about the Tuya app requiring personal information and I completely agree. I used Tuya the first time a few years ago and was super leery. They've since expanded to be a pretty standard interface. Once you use the app to connect to Alexa (or whichever your home automation program of choice is) you can disable it again. The experience was really user friendly. As it is, I now have this set up to water my plants on a weekly basis for just a couple minutes per week. I may invest in some better drip heads that are more adjustable flow drippers so I can customize the amount of water per pot rather than just to the whole circuit. The water pressure is really good. I was surprised. The furthest plant I have from the tank has to be nearly 20 feet and it was already dripping before I got up to check it. They pressure is adequate for plenty of plants. The next step for me will be to research and buy a smart moisture meter so this will automatically water when my plants get to a certain dryness. I love this.    |7.

Assignments will be determined by consensus, taking into account each member\u2019s skills, interests, and developmental goals, while maintaining flexibility to adapt as project needs evolve. Team members will support one another by sharing knowledge, offering feedback, and stepping in when responsibilities overlap or challenges arise. If adjustments are needed, the team will openly discuss and readjust roles to maintain balance and efficiency. Activities and milestones will be tracked using a shared calender, ensuring transparency and accountability. Technical responsibilities will be distributed based on both expertise and the opportunity for learning, so that all members contribute while also expanding their capabilities.</p> <p>Our team will ensure the submissions are on time by setting internal deadlines ahead of official due dates and requiring every member to review and sign off on the final work before submission. To guarantee that each member is prepared for their responsibilities, we will share resources, help each other where possible, and adjust assignments when additional guidance is needed. Feedback from design reviews will be documented in our communication channel, with clear action items assigned and tracked until completion. If a member misses a contribution or fails to meet expectations, the team will first address the issue through internally, offering support and strategies for improvement. Should this continue, the team will implement progressive accountability measures, ranging from redistribution of tasks to formal reporting, with the understanding that consistent failure to improve may result a recommendation to the teaching faculty for transition to another team. Through communication, accountability, and support, we will maintain both individual responsibility and collective success.</p> <p>Appendix Table 2: Project Roles and Duties</p> Role Duties Meeting leader Schedules team meetings, creates and distributes an agenda for each meeting, and runs each meeting Meeting recorder Takes minutes of each team meeting, including attendance, and records action items and to whom they are assigned Assignment leader Coordinates the team's work on a given assignment to Canvas before the due date Project monitor Tracks the team's progress relative to the project schedule (Gantt chart) and keeps team members apprised of deadlines and project status Name Role David Cannon Currently unreachable Jacob Dirks Assignment Leader Austin Gonzalez Meeting Leader Terry Williams Meeting Recorder","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"Appendix/App-Team-Org/#conflict-recognition-resolution","title":"Conflict Recognition &amp; Resolution","text":"<p>Our team recognizes that differences of opinion are an inevitable and valuable part of collaboration, and we will address them to remain focused on completing the project. We will talk through disagreements when they arise and treat them as opportunities for dialogue rather than obstacles to progress. To minimize conflicts of interest with the project, we will ensure that project roles and responsibilities are clearly defined and distributed fairly, preventing any one member from being overburdened. Should conflicts occur, we will resolve them internally through respectful discussion and compromise, and will only escalate issues to the instructor when they cannot be managed within the team.
